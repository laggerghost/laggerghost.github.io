I'm Laggerghost/Manadonymouz, originally from Indonesia (Tegal, Central Java.)
but i live in Manado since 2015.
I start 'hacking activites' since 2014. But very active in 2016 and 2017.

I'm founder of ManadoGhost & RebellionGhost. I stop my team and
join PhantomGhost for 4 months and quit. Now i enter Indonesian Code Party until now.
But there are a few more teams that I joined, for bug bounty programs.

Now, i help maintain the security of the North Sulawesi provincial website,
and enter the head of security in the Exploiter.ID team
Who am i? haha xD

Regards
Manadonymouz
